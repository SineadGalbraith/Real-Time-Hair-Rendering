# Real-Time Hair Rendering

For this project, we were required to pick a SIGGRAPH research paper and implement a real-time interactive demo based on it.

My project has taken inspiration from a paper named Real-Time Hybrid Hair Rendering¹ that was featured in the Eurographics Symposium in 2019. I have scaled down the project to focus simply on rendering hair with a strand-based approach. To help with this project, I have used a similar project² as a reference and guide throughout the project design.

The result of this project allows hair to be rendered on simple shapes. The number of segments per strand of hair and the segment length can be specified before run-time to adjust the appearance of the hair within the program.

C/C++ and OpenGL have been used for this assignment.
